# FirstSteps
This is a simple android app to help children learn the alphabet (associate the sound a with the letter a) and simple words
This project consist of a simple game and a "dinasour quiz". 
You can choose easy, medium, hard.
At the moment it has sounds for lower case letters and upper case letters.  I also have them for b words and c words
I can't garantee the sound files/icnos are free to use as I got them off the web.... need to make my own.
